        <h2 class="title">Professional Background</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Saurim Khan and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My professional experience
            revolves around several startups that I have either helped found, or was one of the first individuals employed at. I have extensive knowledge
            with object oriented languages, including Python, Java, and C/C++, as well as the concepts behind them. I am also trilingual and have years of 
            public speaking experience, along with analytical thinking and leadership skills. I am most interested in the intersection of coding and teaching.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Recreational Background</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When I'm not working on a project or investing my time into work, I enjoy many hobbies, including graphic design, gaming, and working on my car.
            I have a 1995 2 seater Mazda Miata convertible with a 1.6 liter engine that runs at a little over 100 horsepower and weighs under 1.5 tons. As it
            is my first car, I really enjoy developing it further, and watching how my work progresses forward.
